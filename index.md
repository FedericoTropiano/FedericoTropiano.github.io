PhD in Quantitative Finance  
University of Genoa • [Email](federico.tropiano@edu.unige.it) • [CV](cv.pdf)

My research focuses on quantitative finance, currently working on exotic options pricing and machine learning applications.

I published a paper on Risk Management Magazine (RMM) Vol. 19, N. 3 on the pricing of exotic options through the Conditional Monte Carlo.

The working paper I'm working on is focused on improving the explainability of the default probability model with a comparison between native "white boxes" Machine Learning techniques.
