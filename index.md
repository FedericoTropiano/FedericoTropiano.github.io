# Federico Tropiano

PhD in Quantitative Finance  
University of Genoa • [Email](federico.tropiano@edu.unige.it) • [CV](cv.pdf)

I'm an applied researcher, focused on creating user interfaces that expand what people can think and do. My current focus is an augmented book which actively helps people understand, remember, and use what they read.

I believe personal computers can enable transformative tools for thought: environments that radically transform what people can think and do, so much so that we expand the set of thoughts it’s possible to think. I want to produce alien cognitive and creative powers—as wondrous and magical to us today as a modern visual effects artist might seem to a cave painter.

I’m an independent researcher, supported by a crowdfunded grant from my Patreon community. If you find my work interesting, you can become a member to help make it happen. You’ll get regular essays on work-in-progress, access to events, previews of new prototypes, and more.

Prior to my current work, I helped build iOS at Apple and led R&D at Khan Academy.
